## Abstract

* Three layers among three layers:
    1. The C++ program
    2. The GC-back end
    3. The Boolean Logic representation of a function

the function is computed as a netlist of logic gates.

Secure share transfer: TODO (I don't know what this is)

## Description
the framework has two layers: (wtf they literally said 3 in the abstract)
1. protocol execution backend that uses precompiled GC-optimized netlists as input.
    * A net list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlist] describes how an electronic circuit is connected. 
2. program interface to the GC back end. Uses common arithmetic and logocal building blocks.

TODO: heterogeneuous versus homogeneuous GC loops
    * I don't know what they mean by this
