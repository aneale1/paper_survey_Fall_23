#  Effcient Oblivious Transfer Protocols: Moni Naor, Benny Pinkas

To summerize OT:
> the sender is assured that the chooser does not receive more information that it is entitled, while the chooser is assured that the sender does not learn which part of the inputs it received. 

#### Contributions

TODO: I don't fully understand this yet.

* low amortized overhaed
* badwidth/computation trade-off

#### Definitions

* 1-out-of-2 $(M_0,M_1)$... the generalized version is 1-out-of-N
* There only 1 one of the sender or the chooser can be information-theoretic protected\. The other is going to be computationally secure


* Relying on Random oracles
    * Chooser's Security: TODO -> chooser is info secure
    * Sender's Security: TODO -> sender is comp secure

* W/o Random oracles
    * Chooser's Security: TODO -> chooser is comp secure
    * Sender's Security: TODO -> sender is info secure and uses a trusted third party
        * There was something in the beginning about the sender being split into two parts (elaborate) 

#### Assumptions and Model
