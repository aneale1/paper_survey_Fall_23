## MPC presentation sketch

###What is MPC?

start with what MPC entails - yoink from the survey paper

* Thresholding
    * Shamir Secret sharing

* Private Set Intersection
    * two untrusting parties try to calcualte 
### yao's millionare problem

* A basic example of MPC
    * we have two parties that don't trust each other but want to compute some result of their data

* Propose two types of attackers
    * the semi-honest attacker
    * the malicius attacker

### propose the the solution

* Yao's garbled circuits
    * what is garbeling?
    * how does it work?

* There is a non-trivial step...

### Oblivious Transfer (OT)

* Go through how OT work and summerize

### Circle back to the yao's millionare problem

* Apply apply OT

* How are we protected from semi-honest attackers?
* How are we protected froma malicious scenario?

### Let do a live demo of OT -> there are few libraries out there that will allow us to use garbled cicuits

* pull up the Alice's teminal and Bob's terminal
